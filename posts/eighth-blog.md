The Government of Pakistan has announced an increase in fuel prices, effective from February 1, 2025, as per the latest notification from the Finance Division. According to the press release issued on January 31, 2025, the new prices of petroleum products for the next fortnight are as follows:


New Fuel Prices
High-Speed Diesel (HSD): Increased by Rs. 7 per liter, reaching Rs. 267.95 from the previous Rs. 260.95.
Petrol: Increased by Rs. 1 per liter, now priced at Rs. 257.13, up from Rs. 256.13.
This adjustment follows the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA)’s review of international market fluctuations.

Impact of the Price Hike
The increase in diesel prices, in particular, is significant as it affects transportation and agricultural sectors. Diesel is widely used in public transport, goods transportation, and farming equipment, meaning that a rise in its cost could lead to higher inflation and increased prices of essential commodities.

On the other hand, the marginal increase in petrol prices may have a relatively lesser impact on personal vehicle owners but still contributes to the overall rise in commuting costs.


The increase in diesel prices has drawn concerns from transporters and farmers, who fear a ripple effect on the cost of goods and services. Many expect an increase in fares and food prices, which could further strain the average citizen’s budget.
