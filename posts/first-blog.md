Punjab Officially Imposes 60km/h Speed Limit for Bikers  

In a move aimed at reducing road accidents and improving traffic flow, the Punjab government has officially imposed a 60 kilometers per hour speed limit for bikers across the province. This decision was made during a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, marking an important step toward safer roads for everyone.  

Government's Concern Over Road Safety  

Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari spoke at a press conference, expressing concern over the rising number of road deaths in the region. This move aims not only to reduce accidents but also to create a safer environment for motorcyclists, many of whom are involved in high-speed crashes.  

By limiting their speed, the government hopes to minimize the risks associated with reckless riding.  

Building Safer Roads  

Along with the speed limit, the Punjab government is also working on improving infrastructure for bikers. The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) has begun constructing dedicated bike lanes in the city to further protect motorcyclists.  

First Phase: Ferozepur Road

The first phase of the project focuses on Ferozepur Road, and the plan is to extend the initiative to other major roads across all districts of the province.  

Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz highlighted that these lanes will be designed to prevent accidents and promote the smooth flow of traffic.  

> “All major roads in the province will soon have separate bikers’ lanes,” she said, stressing the importance of this safety measure.  

Modern Features of the New Lanes  

The new lanes will feature modern standards, including:  

- Road signs for biker safety  
- Special carpeting to ensure a smooth and secure ride  
- Separate space for bikers, reducing high-speed traffic risks
