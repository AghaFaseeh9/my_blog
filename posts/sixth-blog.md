In a significant move towards a fully automated toll collection system, the National Highway Authority (NHA) has announced a new policy for motorway toll collection in Pakistan. As per the latest notification dated January 31, 2025, the NHA will enforce a 100% M-Tag regime on all motorways, making it mandatory for all vehicles to use M-Tags for toll payments.


Additional Toll 
Starting from February 1, 2025, vehicles that do not have an M-Tag or have a low balance in their M-Tag accounts will be charged an additional 25% toll fee over and above the standard toll rates. Moreover, there will be a minimum surcharge of Rs. 50, ensuring compliance with the new digital toll system.

M-Tag on motorways
NHA Notification
Mandatory M-Tag for Motorway Travel – The policy aims to transition Pakistan’s motorway toll collection towards a fully automated system, reducing cash transactions and improving traffic flow.
Extra Toll for Non-Compliance – Vehicles without an M-Tag or with insufficient balance will have to pay 25% extra toll, with a minimum additional charge of Rs. 50.
Effective Date – The new toll structure will be enforced from February 1, 2025.
What is M-Tag?
M-Tag is a prepaid RFID-based system that allows automatic toll deduction without requiring vehicles to stop at toll plazas. The tag is linked to a user’s account, which must be recharged to ensure smooth passage through toll booths.

Faster Toll Collection – No waiting in long queues.
Contactless Payment – Reduces reliance on cash transactions.
Efficient Traffic Management – Helps reduce congestion at toll plazas.
How to Get an M-Tag in Pakistan?
To avoid penalties, vehicle owners should register for an M-Tag at designated Motorway Toll Plazas or through authorized service centers. The registration process is simple and requires:
✔ Vehicle Registration Certificate (or CNIC)
✔ Mobile Number for account updates
✔ Initial deposit for toll payments

Final Thoughts
This initiative marks a crucial step in digitizing Pakistan’s toll collection system. With the increasing number of vehicles on motorways, M-Tag ensures efficiency, security, and convenience for commuters. Make sure to get your M-Tag before February 1, 2025, to avoid extra charges and ensure a hassle-free travel experience.
